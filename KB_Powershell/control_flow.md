# Control Flow Constructs in PowerShell
In the context of PowerShell, the term "flow" typically refers to "control flow," which is a concept used to describe the order in which individual statements, instructions, 
or function calls are executed or evaluated within a script. 
Control flow determines how and when the code is executed, especially in the presence of structures that can change the execution path, such as conditionals (if-else statements), loops, and function calls.
